# Qe

A simple interface over several background job libraries like Resque, Sidekiq and DelayedJob.

## Usage

In this wild world where a new asynchronous job processing
library is released every once in a while, Qe tries to keep a unified
interface that works with the most famous libraries:

* [Sidekiq](http://mperham.github.com/sidekiq/)
* [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque/)
* [DelayedJob](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job)
* [Qu](https://github.com/bkeepers/qu)
* [Beanstalk](https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd)/[Backburner](http://nesquena.github.com/backburner/)

To set the adapter, just load the file according to your adapter:

``` ruby
require "qe/resque"
require "qe/qu"
require "qe/delayed_job"
require "qe/beanstalk"
```

You also need to require the library you're going to use. If you're using Rails with Bundler, you can simple require the correct file and dependency.

``` ruby
source :rubygems
gem "rails", "3.2.8"

gem "sidekiq"
gem "qe", :require => "qe/sidekiq"

gem "resque"
gem "qe", :require => "qe/resque"

gem "qu"
gem "qe", :require => "qe/qu"

gem "backburner"
gem "qe", :require => "qe/beanstalk"
```

Create a worker that will send e-mails through `ActionMailer`.

``` ruby
class MailerWorker
  include Qe::Worker

  def perform
    Mailer.public_send(options[:mail], options).deliver
  end
end
```

Define our `Mailer` class.

``` ruby
class Mailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def welcome(options)
    @options = options
    mail :to => options[:email]
  end
end
```

Enqueue a job to be processed asynchronously.

``` ruby
MailerWorker.enqueue({
  :mail => :welcome,
  :email => "john@example.org",
  :name => "John Doe"
})
```

### Defining actions

Sometimes you want to create several actions in a single worker, just because is easier. Instead of manually dispatch the action on your perform method, you can
just add the `Qe::Action` module.

``` ruby
class NotificationWorker
  include Qe::Worker
  include Qe::Action

  def shutdown
    puts options[:message]
  end

  def startup
    puts options[:message]
  end

  def default
    puts options[:message]
  end
end
```

Now, you can just enqueue jobs by defining the `:action` option. If no action is defined, then the default is executed.

``` ruby
NotificationWorker.enqueue(:action => :shutdown, :message => "shutting down")
NotificationWorker.enqueue(:action => :startup, :message => "starting up")
NotificationWorker.enqueue(:message => "wat?")
```

The action must be a existing public method. If not defined, `Qe::Action::MissingActionError` exception is raised.

### Development support

Qe comes with development support. Instead of starting up workers on development environment, you can use the `Qe::Immediate` adapter, which executes your worker right away!

``` ruby
Qe.adapter = Qe::Immediate
```

If you're using Rails, you can add the line above to your `config/environments/development.rb` file.

### Testing support

Qe also comes with testing support. Just require the `qe/testing.rb` file
and a fake queuing adapter will be used. All enqueued jobs will be stored
at `Qe.jobs`. Note that this method is only available on testing mode.

``` ruby
require "qe/testing"
Qe.adapter = Qe::Testing
```

If you"re using RSpec, you can require the `qe/testing/rspec.rb` file
instead. This will reset `Qe.jobs` before every spec and will add a
`enqueue` matcher.

``` ruby
# Add the following like to your spec_helper.rb file
require "qe/testing/rspec"

describe "Enqueuing a job" do
  it "enqueues job" do
    expect {
      # do something
    }.to enqueue(MailerWorker).with(:email => "john@example.org")
  end
end
```
